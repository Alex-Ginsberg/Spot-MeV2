# Spot-Me

*The smart way for groups to make Spotify playlists.*

Spot-Me is a Spotify integrated chat app that allows users to form groups with their friends and create playlists together. By forming a 'music-group', a playlist for that group will be added to the members' Spotify accounts. Members can then communicate and share music through Spot-Me. When a shared song receives a certain amount of likes, (specified by the music-group admin) the song will automatically be added to the Spotify playlist, creating a playlist that reflects the preferences of the group.

The user can simply login with their Spotify account. After granting access permissions to Spot-Me, their Spotify account will be integrated with Spot-Me.

When logged in, the user will be able to create a music-group. The user specifies a name and the 'number of likes needed', which refers to how many likes are needed for a song to be added to the playlist.

After creating a music group, the user will be able to access the group in 2 ways: either through the Spot-Me chat or directly in Spotify.

Once in the chat, the user will be able to add any of their friends to the group.

Members of the group can utilize the real-time chat functionality to communicate with teach other. Through the 'jukebox' on thr right of the page, users can find songs from Spotify and send them to the group. Other users then listen to 30-second previews of the song, and decide if they like it. When a song receives enough likes, it will be automatically added to the Spotify playlist.

*Issues being resolved...*
As of now, the UI needs significant improvements to make it more clear how to use the app and to make the site more visually appealing. Additionally, the deployed version has some bugs regarding user access tokens, meaning users may be unable to create and modify Spotify playlists. It is very much a work in progress, but if you would like to see it in its current state, you can visit it at https://spot-mev2.herokuapp.com
